# journaling

DEPRECATED NOW. BEING REWRITTEN IN C TO MATCH LINUX BINARIES.

Done for now since it fits all my needs. May go back if I really want to complete the other tasks.

**Need this in the .bashrc file:**  
`alias journal="cargo run --manifest-path ~/projects/journaling/Cargo.toml"`

TODO:

- ~~Opening an entry by specific date~~
- ~~Optimization~~
- ~~Opening a random journal entry~~
- Slap a quote/categories on each page of the journal.
- Functionality for fully usable on any system? (Directories and such)

Dropped:

- Uses system text editor rather than mousepad?
  (Not possible, there is no unified way that linux assigns a default text editor.)

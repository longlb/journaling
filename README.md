# journaling

**Need this in the .bashrc file:**  
`alias journal="cargo run --manifest-path ~/projects/journaling/Cargo.toml"`

TODO:

~~- Opening an entry by specific date~~
~~- Optimization~~

- Opening a random journal entry
- Uses system text editor rather than mousepad?
- Functionality for fully usable on any system? (Directories and such)
- Slap a quote on to each page of the journal.
